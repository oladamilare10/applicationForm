1. The code defines a functional component called `Forms`.
2. It imports necessary libraries, including React, React Bootstrap components, and Axios for making HTTP requests.
3. The component uses React hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` to manage form state and perform side effects like fetching data from an API.
4. It defines functions like `handleFormSubmit`, `handleImageUpload`, `handleNextPage`, and `handleNextTwo` to handle form submissions, image uploads, and navigation between different form sections.
5. The component renders a form with various input fields, including text fields, radio buttons, and file upload inputs.
6. It uses conditional rendering to display different sections of the form based on the state variables `pageNext`, `pageTwo`, and `pageThree`.
7. It includes error handling and validation logic to ensure that required fields are filled before form submission.
8. It uses Axios to send form data to a backend server and handle any errors that may occur during the process.
9. It displays a progress bar using the `react-progressbar` library to show the progress of the form submission.
10. It includes a modal component (`ModalPage`) to display additional information about the user's location.
11. It uses React Bootstrap components like `Button` and `ProgressBar` for styling and layout.
12. It includes a footer component (`Footer`) and a header component (`Header`) to display additional information at the bottom and top of the form.
13. The component is exported as the default export for use in other parts of the application.

Please note that the code is a large and complex component, so it's not feasible to cover all aspects in this summary. However, the main functionalities and components are described above.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
